What I said is accurate: the FOMC elects its own chair.\n\nI'm well aware of the nuances you outline. My point is different. The Fed chair's perceived power is largely derivative of the FOMC role. Interest rate decisions move markets, dominate headlines, and are what many people (including the current president) most care about. The Board chair's actual statutory responsibilities are narrower than people assume: serve as CEO of the Washington-based institution and testify to Congress twice a year.\n\nIf you unbundled the roles—if the FOMC elected someone other than the presidentially-designated Fed chair pro tempore to preside—people would quickly realize where the real influence lies. The FOMC chair runs the rate decisions. The FOMC chair holds the press conference (when Yellen had the flu and nearly missed her first press conference in 2014, it was the New York Fed president and FOMC vice chair who would have gone in her place). The FOMC chair is who markets listen to. If that person is different from the Board chair, markets and media will follow the FOMC chair—because that's where the action is. The Board chair would become a relatively obscure regulatory administrator by comparison. \n\nSo yes, there could be a legal fight over the Board chair position. But the FOMC can route around that fight by putting monetary policy authority in someone else's hands.
